Description: This building stock model represents residential and commercial
    buildings at customisable regional and temporal resolution. The building
    stock is quantified in floor area and distinguished by building type 
    (SFH/MFH) and location (rural/urban). In each building category,
    construction cohorts are tracked explicitly. This allows to characterise
    buildings specifically for each of subset of buildings. The evolution of the
    building stock follows from the flows of constructed, renovated and
    demolished buildings and is optimised under cost minimisation with a benefit
    for heterogeneity in the choice of construction and renovation alternatives.
    This benefit captures heterogeneity in the preferences of the agents and
    the building structure.
