  brick: Building sector model with heterogeuous renovation and construction of
      the stock
version: 0.0.2.9002
date-released: '2023-06-23'
abstract: This building stock model represents residential and commercial buildings
  at customisable regional and temporal resolution. The building stock is quantified
  in floor area and distinuished by building type (SFH/MFH) and location (rural/urban).
  In each building category, construction cohorts are tracked explicitly. This allows
  to characterise buildings specifically for each of subset of buildings. The evolution
  of the building stock follows from the flows of constructed, renovated and demolished
  buildings and is optimised under cost minimisation with a benefit for heterogeneity
  in the choice of construction and renovation alternatives. This benefit captures
  heterogeneity in the preferences of the aganets and the building structure.
